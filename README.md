This is a project consisting of the famous tic tac toe game. In this case we have developed four game modalities. The first is the local one, which can be played between two people on the same computer. The second and third game modes involve playing against the computer, at medium and impossible difficulty. Finally, the fourth mode includes the online version of the game, which can be played by two users on their devices connected to the same server that was developed using nodeJS.
